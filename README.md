# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


## Project Overview

This is a small React application that fetches current weather data and recommends clothing items based on the temperature and weather conditions. Users can view the weather, see clothing suggestions, and add new garments via a modal form.

The app demonstrates component-based React development, state management, API integration, and conditional rendering.
